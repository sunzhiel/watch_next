Solution for Compulsory Task 2 for SE T38.

## Description
In this program, we are doing more advanced work with spaCy by creating a movie recommendation algorithm that works by comparing the description of a recently watched movie to those of other movies stored in a database (a text file).

This task was completed during the Department for Education (DfE) sponsored Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev (Nov 2022 cohort).

It demonstrates the implementation of natural language processing.

## Instructions
Download the python file (watch_next.py) along with the text file (moviesr.txt). Ensure you save both files to the same folder.
Run the python file to see the recommendation.
